The view system in Rocket compiles Jade templates and sends them to the user. When you need to render a template, you just pass your JSON data to the client and tell them which template to render.</p><p>In the future we'd like to support other template engines, though there are excellent reasons to use Jade. First, Jade is written in Javascript which makes it easy to run client side. Second, it has a syntax that is similar to HAML, but slightly more terse (Which is saying something). Jade is also used by several Node.js based web frameworks, such as Express.</p></div><div id="footer"><p>Rocket.io and all associated documentation are released under the MIT license.
