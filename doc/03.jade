h1 MVC

p Rocket includes a simple MVC framework that should feel fairly familiar to any Rails developer. Rocket doesn't aim to be API compatible, but it does try to be close enough that you shouldn't have to dig through too much documentation to grok it.

p Technically it's not a full MVC framework, as we've omitted the model component. We feel it's best to let you choose your own model solution, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
