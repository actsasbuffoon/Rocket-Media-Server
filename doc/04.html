It's a very simple ORM that aims to give you a small, highly consistent API for accessing your database in an evented manner. It is currently built on MongoDB, though we are interested in allowing the database to be switched in a future release.</p><p>Why MongoDB? Mongo stores all records as JSON, which is a great fit for Rocket's JSON oriented approach. Mongo also supports sharding, replica sets, JSON based indexed queries, and it's very fast. Future versions should also include full-text search out of the box!</p><p>ModelRocket has many features that are similar to ActiveModel, but with a focus on simplicity and event orientation.</p><h2>Basic Setup</h2><h2>Validations</h2><p>ModelRocket supports validations that are similar to ActiveModel.</p></div><div id="footer"><p>Rocket.io and all associated documentation are released under the MIT license.
