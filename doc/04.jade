h1 ModelRocket

p ModelRocket is the M part of the MVC framework. It's a very simple ORM that aims to give you a small, highly consistent API for accessing your database in an evented manner. It is currently built on MongoDB, though we are interested in allowing the database to be switched in a future release.

p Why MongoDB? Mongo stores all records as JSON, which is a great fit for Rocket's JSON oriented approach. Mongo also supports sharding, replica sets, JSON based indexed queries, and it's very fast. Future versions should also include full-text search out of the box!

p ModelRocket has many features that are similar to ActiveModel, but with a focus on simplicity and event orientation.
