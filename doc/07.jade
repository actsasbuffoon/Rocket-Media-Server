h1 Roadmap

p Rocket is still in very early development, and there's lot that needs to be done.

ul
  li ModelRocket will support basic relations. Probably has_one, has_many, belongs_to, as well as variants that involve embedded records.
  li
    \ModelRocket needs more validation types to better match the functionality of ActiveRecord.
    ul
      li acceptance (like TOS)
      li associated (only allow if associated records work, too)
      li confirmation (like matching password fields)
      li uniqueness
  li Deferred processing in Ruby or Javascript would be a great feature, especially since we already use Redis for tracking message queues. Job queues would require almost no additional work. Allowing JS via V8 could provide a nice option for high performance.
  li GroundControl doesn't currently support anything like a redirect. State gets a little bit messy in an evented app, so we'll need to be sure that we can maintain state while passing control to another action.
  li More callbacks. We need to provide a JS callback for after the user first establishes a connection, after the user reconnects, and a few other things. We also need more callbacks on the Ruby side.
  li Rocket is currently just some files you have to drop into a directory. It works, but a gem and some generators would be much more convenient.
  li File uploads are a bit tricky. HTTP makes it fairly easy, but we aren't using HTTP. We could either pipe the files through HTTP, or use the JS File API. There are some significant questions to be answered on this topic. Look into Water Under Ice.
  li Better documentation!
  li Filters for controllers.
  li Better way for users to include JS and CSS files without having to modify the main HTML file.
  li A CSS substitute like SASS or Stylus.
  li File watchers that recompile files on change when in development mode.
