Job queues would require almost no additional work. Allowing JS via V8 could provide a nice option for high performance.</li><li>More callbacks. We need to provide a JS callback for after the user first establishes a connection, after the user reconnects, and a few other things. We also need more callbacks on the Ruby side.</li><li>Rocket is currently just some files you have to drop into a directory. It works, but a gem and some generators would be much more convenient.</li><li>Better documentation!</li><li>Filters for controllers.</li><li>Better way for users to include JS and CSS files without having to modify the main HTML file.</li><li>A CSS substitute like SASS or Stylus.</li><li>File watchers that recompile files on change when in development mode.</li><li>Can we use Thin or Sinatra's param handler?</li></ul></div><div id="footer"><p>Rocket.io and all associated documentation are released under the MIT license.
