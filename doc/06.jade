h1 Roadmap

p Rocket is still in very early development, and there's lot that needs to be done.

ul
  li Deferred processing in Ruby or Javascript would be a great feature, especially since we already use Redis for tracking message queues. Job queues would require almost no additional work. Allowing JS via V8 could provide a nice option for high performance.
  li GroundControl doesn't currently support anything like a redirect. State gets a little bit messy in an evented app, so we'll need to be sure that we can maintain state while passing control to another action.
  li More callbacks. We need to provide a JS callback for after the user first establishes a connection, after the user reconnects, and a few other things. We also need more callbacks on the Ruby side.
  li Rocket is currently just some files you have to drop into a directory. It works, but a gem and some generators would be much more convenient.
  li File uploads are a bit tricky. Rather than attempt to provide a widget, why not provide a JS class/object/function/whatever that they register the download with, then they can access the object to do whatever they want. For instance, some users may prefer to create a record and defer the file upload, and attach the file after. Others may prefer to defer record creation until the file upload is complete. This would allow them that flexibility. It would also be one less thing tied to a JS framework. The object would only need a few callbacks, such as start, complete, tick, etc.
  li Better documentation!
  li Filters for controllers.
  li Better way for users to include JS and CSS files without having to modify the main HTML file.
  li A CSS substitute like SASS or Stylus.
  li File watchers that recompile files on change when in development mode.
  li Can we use Thin or Sinatra's param handler?
