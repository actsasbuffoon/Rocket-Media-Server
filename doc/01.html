</h2><p>Rocket.io is an evented realtime application framework written in Ruby. Unlike Rails, Sinatra, or any number of other web frameworks, Rocket.io isn't for making websites. Rocket.io is all about building realtime web applications.</p><p>Rocket apps usually consist of a single page, and all data is sent and received via WebSockets. Rocket is also entirely evented, much like Node.js. Rocket provides you with a serverside AND clientside MVC framework, as well as handling users and reestablishing the WebSocket connection in the event of a disconnection.</p><h2>Why Should I Use Rocket.io?</h2><p>Rocket.io is fast. Like, insanely fast. When using HTTP every single request has to instantiate a TCP connection, send a few kilobytes of headers, and often fork the process or spawn a thread. Rocket.io doesn't do any of that.</p><p>Since Rocket.io uses WebSockets for everything, you always have a persistent connection to the user. Nothing to instantiate, just push the message through.</p><p>WebSockets also don't use headers like HTTP. The overhead on a WebSocket request is literally just a few bytes!</p><p>As for concurrency, most web frameworks use threads or processing forking. Both methods are slow and consume a lot of memory. Rocket uses neither. Instead we use an evented programming model, much like Node.js and Nginx. This results in very fast, highly concurrent code.</p><p>Aside from speed, WebSockets allow you to push data directly to a user. No need for AJAX, comet, long-polling, etc.</p><h2>Why Shouldn't I Use Rocket.io?</h2><p>Rocket.io is aimed at one thing; realtime web applications. There are many sorts of app that are well suited to traditional web frameworks such as a CMS, or a blog.</p><p>Because everything in Rocket is loaded via WebSockets, things made with Rocket are virtually invisible to search engines. That's a big deal for a blog, but makes sense if you're building a desktop-like application in the browser. Would it make sense for a search engine to index the preferences panel in iTunes?</p><p>Rocket's performance is very admirable, but a lot of it owes to the evented programming model. Simply put, you're going to have to use evented database drivers, all your calls to external services are going to need to be done in an evented manner, etc. If you fail to do that, then Rocket will block on every request, and your server will become unbearably slow. There's no way out of it; you're going to have to write callbacks.</p></div><div id="footer"><p>Rocket.io and all associated documentation are released under the MIT license.
